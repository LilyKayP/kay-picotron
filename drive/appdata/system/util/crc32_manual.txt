usage: crc32 [-s|-p] [-a <crcs>|-d <crcs>|-r <crcs>|-V] <input>
 Calculate and output CRC32 hash of input file,
 directory, or string
Options:
  -s|--string
    Don't treat input as path, only as string
    (default: auto)
  -p|--path
    Don't treat input as string, only as path
    (default: auto)
  -a|--append <crcs>
    Append hash to .crcs file (if not present)
    Does not accept an argument if used with -V
  -d|--delete <crcs>
    Delete hash from .crcs file (if present)
    Does not accept an argument if used with -V
  -r|--replace <crcs>
    Empty .crcs file and add only this hash
    Does not accept an argument if used with -V
  -V|--version <new>
    For every file that exists in input directory,
    add the CRC32 for that file to the relevant
    .crcs alongside the file path.
    (Useful for yotta upgrade .crcs)
    Overwriting the action with -d or -r works.
    (Defaults to -a/--append)
    
If you give it a file, you'll get the file's hash back.
If you give it a folder, it will hash every file within
the folder then hash that output one more time. Yikes.
If you give it neither a file nor a folder, you'll get
the input string's hash back. Note that you are not
expected to quote-encapsulate the input string.

eg: > crc32 This is a test string
    1800336237 This is a test string

This utility file can be included in code as a
library to expose the crc32() function:

  crc32(input: string|path, is_file: boolean|nil = nil): string
  
This will give you just a hash number alone.
It will attempt to autodetect if it's a file if you
omit is_file, based on file presence.

It will complain if you try to have it CRC a
non-file non-folder filesystem object. You can
silence it by setting __crc32_silent = true
